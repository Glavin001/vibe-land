/**
 * Real joint capacities for the vehicles (VIBE_REAL_VEHICLE_JOINTS=1, opt-in;
 * docs/verification/SCENARIOS.md, "Recalibrations").
 *
 * The joint profile (strength-profile.mjs) gives each joint an effective stress
 * (parent metal x joint efficiency, reality.mjs jointReferences) and the stage
 * multiplies it by the bond's measured contact area. For two members that
 * merely touch over a face -- a roof panel lying on its cage, a fascia on its
 * grille -- that area is the face, up to 0.24 m2, and the joint reads as 70 MN:
 * 1,400 times the truck's weight and ~100-1000 times what the welds or bolts
 * that really hold it can carry (spot welds 4-10 kN each, AWS D8.9M / ISO 14273
 * tensile-shear; M10 8.8 bolts 46 kN, EN 1993-1-8 Table 3.4). The vehicle then
 * cannot lose a panel, while its wheels -- whose lug studs are modelled at
 * their real section (ISO 898-1) -- are the weakest joints it has.
 *
 * A joint can never carry more than the members it joins: a weld or a bolt
 * group fails no later than the parent metal beside it (EN 1993-1-8 4.5.2,
 * 4.7: a full-strength weld develops the connected part's resistance; 3.6.1:
 * net-section rupture of the connected part). So each joint's capacity is
 * bounded by the smaller of its two members' cross-sections at the joint's
 * stress: section = the member's material volume over its length (a tube's
 * annulus, a panel's thickness x width), its volume from its (budgeted) mass
 * and its material's density. Stiffness keeps the measured area (geometry).
 * A wheel's mount keeps its counted studs.

/**
 * Ductile metal joints (docs/verification/SCENARIOS.md, engine item 5).
 *
 * A metal joint does not fracture at its capacity: it yields and keeps
 * carrying it while it deforms, and ruptures only once its deformation is
 * spent. The stage models that as a ductile material
 * (PxDestructionMaterial::ductileSlip, the impact solve): at capacity the
 * joint carries its capacity and breaks when its slip over a tick passes the
 * ultimate slip. It is the building joints' model (town-kit materials.mjs
 * ULTIMATE_SLIP; veneer-houses.mjs jointMaterial), and as there, under real
 * capacities a joint is elastic up to its capacity (elastic = fatal): the
 * stage's only path between yield and rupture is section loss at its damage
 * rate (FIDELITY_AUDIT C2, a MODEL), where steel between f_y and f_u strain
 * hardens and holds (EN 1993-1-1 3.2.2: f_u / f_y >= 1.10).
 *
 * Ultimate slip: a metal joint ruptures by necking of the metal that carries
 * it -- the parent member beside a full-strength weld (EN 1993-1-8 4.7), the
 * net section, the fastener. Necking elongation scales with the square root of
 * the section (Barba's law), which is why tensile elongation is specified on
 * the proportional gauge L0 = 5.65 sqrt(S0) (EN ISO 6892-1). So the slip at
 * rupture is A L0 = A 5.65 sqrt(S), with S the section that carries the joint
 * (the member's section where the section bound applies, else the joint's
 * area; one stud of a wheel's set) and A the metal's elongation after fracture:
 * - steel (structural members and their welds): 15% (EN 1993-1-1 3.2.2(1));
 * - wheel studs, property class 10.9: 9% (ISO 898-1 Table 3);
 * - aluminium alloy 6061-T6: 8% (EN 755-2, extrusions).
 * Composites, glass, rubber, webbing and upholstery joints stay brittle.
